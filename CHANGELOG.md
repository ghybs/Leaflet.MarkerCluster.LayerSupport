# Leaflet.MarkerCluster.LayerSupport Changelog


## 2.0.0 (2018-02-06) for Leaflet 1.x

- **Breaking change:** `singleAddRemoveBufferDuration` option now defaults to `0`
(i.e. it is disabled) instead of `100` ms previously.
Fix this plugin breaking `marker.setLatLng()` ([#11](https://github.com/ghybs/Leaflet.MarkerCluster.LayerSupport/issues/11))
and making `addLayer` unexpectedly asynchronous ([#12](https://github.com/ghybs/Leaflet.MarkerCluster.LayerSupport/issues/12)).


## 1.0.5 (2017-07-19) for Leaflet 1.x

- Fix throttling different operation types (i.e. mixed `addLayer` and `removeLayer`) [#10](https://github.com/ghybs/Leaflet.MarkerCluster.LayerSupport/pull/10) (by [AsamK](https://github.com/AsamK))
- Docs: update debug and demo pages to Leaflet 1.1.0 and Leaflet.markercluster 1.0.6.


## 1.0.4 (2017-05-13) for Leaflet 1.0

- Fix use of `addLayers`, `removeLayers` and therefore `chunkedLoading` option ([#8](https://github.com/ghybs/Leaflet.MarkerCluster.LayerSupport/issues/8)).
- Add build script for README.
